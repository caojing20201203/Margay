# Reply Guidelines

Guidelines for replying to social media comments and mentions across all platforms.

## Core Principles

1. **Be helpful, not promotional** — Answer questions directly. Don't turn every reply into a sales pitch.
2. **Match the platform tone** — X is casual, HN is technical, Reddit values depth.
3. **Be concise** — Respect people's time. Get to the point.
4. **Acknowledge criticism gracefully** — Thank people for feedback, even negative. Never be defensive.
5. **Use the user's language** — Reply in the same language the comment was written in.

## Reply Strategy by Category

### Questions

- Answer directly and completely
- Include relevant links or references if helpful
- If you don't know, say so honestly
- Example: "Great question! [direct answer]. Here's more detail: [link]"

### Positive Feedback

- Thank sincerely but briefly
- Add value (share a related tip, upcoming feature, etc.)
- Don't over-respond to simple compliments
- Example: "Thanks! Glad it helped. BTW, [related useful tip]."

### Suggestions / Feature Requests

- Acknowledge the idea
- Be honest about feasibility/timeline
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Example: "Interesting idea! We've been thinking about that too. No timeline yet but it's on our radar."

### Bug Reports / Issues

- Thank for reporting
- Ask for reproduction steps if needed
- Provide a workaround if available
- Example: "Thanks for reporting this. Could you share [specific info]? In the meantime, [workaround] should help."

### Negative / Critical Comments

- Don't ignore, but don't over-engage with trolls
- Separate valid criticism from noise
- For valid criticism: acknowledge, explain context, describe what you're doing about it
- For trolls: brief factual response or no response
- Example: "Fair point. We chose [approach] because [reason], but we hear the concern about [issue]."

## Platform-Specific Tone

### X (Twitter)

- Keep replies under 200 characters when possible
- Use casual, conversational tone
- Emojis are fine but don't overdo it
- Thread for longer explanations

### Hacker News

- Technical, precise, evidence-based
- Reference source code, papers, benchmarks when relevant
- Respect the community's preference for substance over style
- Avoid marketing language — it gets downvoted

### Reddit

- Match the subreddit's culture
- More detailed than X, less formal than HN
- Use formatting (bold, lists) for readability
- Be a community member, not a brand account

## Things to Avoid

- Generic "Thanks for your feedback!" without substance
- Copy-paste replies (each should feel personal)
- Arguing with people publicly
- Making promises about dates or features
- Sharing private/internal information
- Replying to obvious spam or bait
- Using hashtags in replies (except on X when relevant)
